# BK-0010-SOLDAT.BIN-Extracted-Music
Extracted and edited music generating code fragment from a game "SOLDAT.BIN".

I love music from this game, but game inner timer don't let to listen it for long.

So I decided do find a piece of code that is responded for music playback,
then extract and correct it for the next execution.

With a help of the 'PDPy11' - a compiler for PDP-11 by imachug
(https://github.com/imachug/PDPy11) this task goes much easier.

Attached test.bin file can be executed on BK-0010-01 emulator.
